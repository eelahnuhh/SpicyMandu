        Hello and welcome to the launch of the first SpicyMandu website and our
        introductory blog post! My name is Ilana Smalls, the founder of
        SpicyMandu, and I am excited to finally share all of what this blog has
        to offer. For years, I have served as a helpful role model to my friends
        and peers who were seeking inspiration, help, or advice. In 2018, I
        finally decided to own that role and be intentional about it. I started
        writing about my passions, my thoughts, and curious wonderings about our
        society. I founded SpicyMandu with a mission to give others a taste of
        what goes on in my mind, and it has been a wild success ever since.

        <strong>Why I started my blog</strong>
      </div>
      I was blessed to be born into a family that would foster my desire to
      travel all over the world. From the moment I was born, and from what I
      remember, I have always had the opportunity to explore a whole new
      location and culture and expand my knowledge in that way. Traveling feeds
      my desire to learn, explore, and experience a whole new world. With each
      new adventure I always want the moments to last forever. And memory only
      goes so far. This idea led to my passion for photography. I love capturing
      the moment and I am always the person pulling at the camera to keep those
      memories with us forever. Now, I am wanting to share those memories, and
      my beloved passions, with the world. Join me on a glimpse into my life and
      travel through beautiful photos and videos that will be embedded in each
      and every blog post.

        <strong>Side note</strong>
      </div>
      Although writing has never been my strong suit and I have limited
      knowledge of what it really means to be a “blogger”; I am excited to share
      what I have learned over the years and be a resource that will inspire
      others. I am ready to learn through trial and error and read a lot of
      discussion posts in my pastime to truly figure this all out ^O^! Feel free
      to always share your advice and communicate anything with me as this
      journey begins :).
      <div>
        <strong>Making it all happen</strong>
      </div>
      After spontaneously getting the urge to start a blog, I wanted to act
      FAST. To my surprise, making a website and starting a blog doesn`t happen
      as quickly as you`d think… Lucky for me I have some AMAZING supporters by
      my side who have already been here every step of the way. I can`t wait to
      simultaneously make myself and them proud with how far this has already
      come!

      Before I go I want to send you all off with one of my favorite quotes.
      “There was no one near to confuse me, so I was forced to become original.”
      - Joseph Hadyn As I type this up I keep looking back at my name…
      SpicyMandu… I could really go for some spicy Korean dumplings right now
      ^O^!
      <div>Bye for now!</div>
